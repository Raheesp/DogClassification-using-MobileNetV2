### Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for dog breed classification. Using MobileNetV2, a lightweight model optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications, we achieve high efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, providing a comprehensive workflow from raw data to deployment-ready model.

### Dataset

The model is trained on the [Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) from Kaggle. This dataset contains thousands of labeled images across 120 dog breeds, making it ideal for fine-grained classification tasks.

### Model Architecture

We use MobileNetV2, a model designed for resource-constrained environments. Its architecture employs depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computations. It includes inverted residuals and linear bottlenecks, which help maintain model efficiency and accuracy. The last few layers are customized for dog breed classification.

### Environment Setup

1. **Platform**: This project was developed on Google Colab.
2. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - TensorFlow
   - Keras
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib

### Model Training

**Preprocess the Dataset**: Resize and normalize images for input into MobileNetV2.
**Transfer Learning**: We utilize MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuning the model on the dog breed dataset.
**Compile and Train**: The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function for multi-class classification.

### Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to determine accuracy and other performance metrics. We plot confusion matrices and classification reports to analyze performance across different dog breeds.


### Usage

**Load the Model**: Load the trained model weights to classify new images.
**Predict Dog Breed**: Provide a new dog image to the model, which outputs the predicted breed.

print(predict_breed('path/to/dog/image.jpg'))

### Results
The model achieved a test accuracy of 75% (replace with actual result) on the dog breed classification dataset. Visualizations of training and validation accuracy and loss curves are provided to showcase the modelâ€™s learning process.
